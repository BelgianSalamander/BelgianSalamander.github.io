                    SAIS (Short for Salamander's AI Session) is an activity I originally created for the New Zealand Olympiad in Informatics January Camp. The name SAIS is inspired
                    by the Australian camp's version, <a href="https://github.com/aioc/phais">PHAIS</a>. The goal of SAIS is to create an agent to play some basic multiplayer game (for example,
                    multiplayer snake). Then, you can submit your agent to the SAIS website and it will automatically pit it against other agents. On the SAIS website you can also spectate agents'
                    games live and view a ranking of all the agents.
                    <br><br>
                    The whole SAIS framework is created to make it relatively easy to make your own games and not be limited to just snake.
                    <br><br>
                    SAIS is primarily written in Rust and when I crated it I explored various technologies and overall learnt a lot. These inlcude:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tokenisation + Recusrive Descent Parsers</li>
                        <li>Code Generation</li>
                        <li>Executing untrusted code</li>
                        <li>SQL Databases and ORMs</li>
                        <li>Rust Async Code</li>
                        <li>The HTTP Protocol</li>
                        <li>Server-Sent Events</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Recursive Descent Parsers? Why?</h2>
                    As stated previously one goal of this project was to make it as easy as possible to implement your own games (so this project isn't restricted to just playing snake).
                    The first step in creating a game is defining the interface the agents will need to implement. This is done in a <span class="inline-code">.game</span> file which looks like below:
                    <pre class="code">type GridCell = i32;

type Pos = struct {
    row: u32,
    col: u32
};

type Move = enum {
    Up, Down, Left, Right
};

function init = (snake_id: GridCell, num_rows: u32, num_cols: u32, num_snakes: u32);

function get_move = (grid: [[GridCell]], head: Pos) -> Move;</pre>
                    The file above defines three types. A <span class="inline-code">GridCell</span> type which is actually just an integer in disguise. A <span class="inline-code">Pos</span> type
                    with two member fields <span class="inline-code">row</span> and <span class="inline-code">col</span>, representing a pair of integer coordinates. And finally an enum type
                    describing the possible moves a snake can do.

                    <br><br>It also defines two functions that the agent must implement. An <span class="inline-code">init</span> function which presumably would be called at the start of a game,
                    providing information like the size of the grid and the number of snakes playing ahead of time. Then there is the <span class="inline-code">get_move</span> function
                    which would be called every game tick, giving the agent the state of the grid, and the position of its head and asking it to select a move to perform.

                    <br><br>The structure of this file is very heavily inspired by the rust type system and is quite simple. Because of its simplicity, the entire tokenizer and parser for this file
                    format is <a href="https://github.com/BelgianSalamander/ai_games/blob/master/gamedef/src/parser.rs">only about 400 lines of code.</a>

                    <h2>Code Generation</h2>
                    The information stored in these files is used to automatically generate a lot of code, in various different languages, designed to speed up the process of implementing these games.

                    <h3>Client-Side Code</h3>
                    The only generated code any person "competing" on SAIS would see are the skeletons for implementing an agent. Firstly, all the type definitions are translated into suitable types
                    in the required language. Currently, the only two supported languages are Python and C++. The C++ type definition for the file above would like below.
                    <pre class="code"><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;array&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;


typedef int32_t GridCell;

struct Pos {
    uint32_t row;
    uint32_t col;
};

enum class Move : uint8_t {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right,
};</code></pre>
                    Then, it generates a simple skeleton file for an agent implementation, like below.
                    <pre class="code"><code class="language-cpp">#include "game_types.h"

void init(GridCell& snake_id, uint32_t num_rows, uint32_t num_cols, uint32_t num_snakes) {
    //Implement logic here...
}

Move get_move(std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;GridCell&gt;&gt;& grid, Pos& head) {
    //Implement logic here...
    return Move::Up;
}</code></pre>            
                    <h3>Agent "Interactor"</h3>
                    The server cannot directly interact with a program in the format above. All the agents are run as separate processes to the server so there needs to be a way for 
                    the server and a running agent to communicate. This is where the "interactor" comes in. The interactor for C++ would look something like below (the version below is shortened quite a bit). It deserializes commands
                    from the server and then serializes the results to send them back to the server. In the case of C++, the agent would be compiled against the interactor code.
                    <pre class="code"><code class="language-cpp">#include "game.h"
#include "interact_lib.hpp"

/* Some (de)serialization helper methods defined here */

int main(){
    std::cerr &lt;&lt; "Starting Interactor!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    while(true) {
        uint8_t func_id;
        readData&lt;uint8_t&gt;(func_id);
        if (func_id == 0) { // init
            std::cerr &lt;&lt; "Calling function init" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
            GridCell param_snake_id;
            read_GridCell(param_snake_id);
            uint32_t param_num_rows;
            readData&lt;uint32_t&gt;(param_num_rows);
            uint32_t param_num_cols;
            readData&lt;uint32_t&gt;(param_num_cols);
            uint32_t param_num_snakes;
            readData&lt;uint32_t&gt;(param_num_snakes);
            
            init(param_snake_id, param_num_rows, param_num_cols, param_num_snakes);
        } else if (func_id == 1) { // get_move
            std::cerr &lt;&lt; "Calling function get_move" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
            std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;GridCell&gt;&gt; param_grid;
            uint32_t size_0;
            readData&lt;uint32_t&gt;(size_0);
            param_grid.resize(size_0);
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; size_0; i++) {
                std::vector&lt;GridCell&gt;& baseAddr_0 = param_grid[i];
                uint32_t size_1;
                readData&lt;uint32_t&gt;(size_1);
                baseAddr_0.resize(size_1);
                for (int i = 0; i &lt; size_1; i++) {
                    GridCell& baseAddr_1 = baseAddr_0[i];
                    read_GridCell(baseAddr_1);
                }
            }
            Pos param_head;
            read_Pos(param_head);
            
            Move ret = get_move(param_grid, param_head);
            write_Move(ret);
            flushStreams();
        } 
    }
}</code></pre>
                    For C++, a small <span class="inline-code">game.h</span> file is also created for a nicer compilation process.
                    <pre class="code"><code class="language-cpp">#include "game_types.h"

void init(GridCell& snake_id, uint32_t num_rows, uint32_t num_cols, uint32_t num_snakes);
Move get_move(std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;GridCell&gt;&gt;& grid, Pos& head);</code></pre>

                    <h3>Server-side Interaction</h3>
                    Now finally, we need the actual server code that is running the games to be able to smoothly interact with running agents. To do this, I leveraged the full power of rust's procedural
                    macro system. With a single line of rust that looks like <span class="inline-code">make_server!("res/games/nzoi_snake.game");</span>, all the serialization logic is created and an 
                    <span class="inline-code">Agent</span> struct is defined that allows you to easily call the functions an agent has defined. The <span class="inline-code">Agent</span> struct also
                    makes full use of asynchronous rust. All of this means, that if you want to get the next move for a snake all you have to do is something like:
                    <pre class="code"><code class="language-rust">let res = agent.get_move(&grid, &head).await;</code></pre>
                    Of course a little bit more logic may be needed to add a time limit to the function call and to handle agents that crash, but overall it is still quite simple to use.
                
                    <h2>Executing Untrusted Code</h2>
                    Executing untrusted code is at the core of this project. Students can submit any valid C++/Python program and it may be run. This typically poses a serious threat. However,
                    there are already many pre-existing solutions.

                    <br><br>I used the <a href="https://github.com/ioi/isolate" target="_blank">IOI Isolate</a> sandbox to solve this issue. The Isolate sandbox is maintained by
                    Martin Mareš from the International Olympiad in Informatics' International Scientific Committee. It is used in the IOI and many other programming contests to run code students
                    submit, so it seemed like the perfect option. It allows code to be run with very restricted permissions. Namely, the way I use it, when agents run they:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cannot spawn subprocesses</li>
                        <li>Cannot access the internet, or the server's local network</li>
                        <li>Cannot read or create any files</li>
                        <li>Can only use a limited amount of memory</li>
                    </ul>
                    Most of these are in fact default settings of the sandbox and would need to be explicitly disabled. That way, there isn't much of a risk of inadvertently disabling
                    anything critical to the safety of the server.

                    <h2>SQLite</h2>
                    I used SQLite3 as a database to ensure that any data persists between program restarts. The database is quite simple, it stores only "users" and "agents".
                    While the schema was quite simple I did end up using an ORM (sea-orm) which perhaps ended up being a little bit overkill.

                    <h2>Asynchronous Rust Code</h2>
                    The async engine I used was <span class="inline-code">async-std</span>. There wasn't much reason behind this, it just seemed like a reasonable choice. I did end up regretting this a little
                    though. One of the main annoyances was that a lot of other async rust crates use <span class="inline-code">tokio</span> instead, which limited the number
                    of creates I could use. Secondly, the facilities <span class="inline-code">async-std</span> has for reading/writing from files/pipes (for example, to communicate with agents) is rather
                    limited. For example, the only method it seems to offer for reading is <a href="https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/io/trait.Read.html"><span class="inline-code">Read::poll_read(...)</span></a>
                    does not actually return a future, so I ended up having to build my own future types around them. For example, my implementation for reading ended up looking like below.
                    <pre class="code"><code class="language-rust">impl&lt;'data&gt; Future for ReadFuture&lt;'data&gt; {
    type Output = Result&lt;(), Error&gt;;

    fn poll(mut self: Pin&lt;&mut Self&gt;, cx: &mut std::task::Context&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; std::task::Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt; {
        if self.remaining == 0 { // If future was constructed to read 0 bytes
            return std::task::Poll::Ready(Ok(()));
        }

        let res = {
            let ReadFuture {ref stdout, ref mut data, ref pos, ref remaining} = &mut *self;
            let mut stdout = stdout.lock().unwrap();
            let pinned = Pin::new(&mut *stdout);
            pinned.poll_read(cx, &mut data[*pos..*pos + *remaining])
        };

        match res {
            std::task::Poll::Ready(Ok(0)) =&gt; std::task::Poll::Ready(Err(Error::new(ErrorKind::UnexpectedEof, "Unexpected EOF"))),
            std::task::Poll::Ready(Ok(bytes)) =&gt; {
                self.pos += bytes;
                self.remaining -= bytes;
                if self.remaining == 0 {
                    std::task::Poll::Ready(Ok(()))
                } else {
                    cx.waker().wake_by_ref();
                    std::task::Poll::Pending
                }
            },
            std::task::Poll::Ready(Err(e)) =&gt; std::task::Poll::Ready(Err(e)),
            std::task::Poll::Pending =&gt; std::task::Poll::Pending,
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
                    While I would have preferred to not have had to create futures like this, it definitely taught me a lot about asynchronous programming in rust. I did later realise that somewhat simpler
                    solution exists using <span class="inline-code">std::future::poll_fn()</span>.

                    <h2>HTTP/SSE</h2>
                    In part because I wanted to mess around with how HTTP works, no HTTP crate was used in this project. Instead, I handle it most of it myself. While this is definitely not the best
                    way to do it in terms of guaranteed functionality, it has not failed my so far and it has been quite educational.
